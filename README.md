# 🔍 Project VeracityStream: Problem Statement

## 🚨 The Challenge (Problem Statement 3)
Generative AI models are widely used for research, learning, and decision-making. However, these models often generate **factually incorrect information** presented with high confidence.

A critical extension of this problem is the creation of **fake citations, non-existent references, and broken links**, which appear legitimate but cannot be verified. This makes it difficult for users to trust AI-generated content and may lead to:
* **Misinformation**
* **Legal Risks**
* **Ethical Concerns**

## 💡 The Solution
Build a system that can **detect, flag, and verify** factual claims and citations generated by AI models, helping users distinguish between reliable and unreliable AI-produced information.

## 🚩 The Challenge: AI’s “Confidence Gap”

Generative AI models are widely used for research, learning, and decision-making.  
However, they often generate **factually incorrect information with high confidence**, leading to trust, legal, and ethical risks.

**VeracityStream** is an automated verification layer designed to address:

- **Fabricated Facts** – Claims without empirical evidence  
- **Ghost Citations** – Fake, broken, or non-existent references  
- **Misinformation Risks** – Harm caused by unreliable AI-generated content

* `veracity_backend/`: Python FastAPI engine & NLP logic.

## 📂 Project Structure (Frontend)

Implemented in **Commit 2**, the Flutter application follows a **feature-first architecture with MVVM-inspired separation**, ensuring scalability and clean state management.

```text
lib/
├── core/
│   ├── constants/       # App-wide strings and veracity labels
│   ├── theme/           # Material 3 theme with custom veracity colors
│   └── network/         # HTTP/Dio client configuration
├── features/
│   └── verification/    # Core feature: AI text analysis & UI
│       ├── models/      # Claim and source data models
│       ├── view/        # VeracityHighlighter and result widgets
│       └── viewmodel/   # API communication and verification state
└── main.dart            # App entry point and theme initialization
```

**Flow:**

1. User inputs AI-generated text or a URL  
2. Text is decomposed into individual factual claims  
3. Claims and citations are verified using academic and web sources  
4. Results are scored and visualized in a color-coded UI  

---
## ✨ Core Features (Beta)
* **NLP Claim Decomposition**: Breaks long-form AI responses into individual factual units using spaCy.
* **Real-time Link Auditing**: Uses `requests` to ping generated citations and identify "Ghost Citations" (404s).
* **Confidence Mapping**: Differentiates between verified sources and hallucinated references.

## 🎯 Key Objectives & Impact

### ✅ Automated Claim Extraction
Breaks unstructured AI text into independent, testable factual units using NLP.

### 🔗 Citation Audit Engine
- Validates URLs in real time  
- Detects fake or broken references  
- Verifies metadata against academic databases  

### 🎨 Semantic Veracity Mapping
A Flutter-based UI that highlights:
- 🟢 Verified claims  
- 🟡 Uncertain claims  
- 🔴 False or unverifiable claims

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
1. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd veracity_backend`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the server: `python main.py`

### Frontend (Flutter)
1. Navigate to the app directory: `cd veracity_app`
2. Get packages: `flutter pub get`
3. Run the app: `flutter run`
